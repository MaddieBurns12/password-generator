# Password Generator Starter Code

Given a mockup of a password generator and a description of how it would work, I modified the JavaScript file in order to meet the requirements. This was accomplished by:

    1. Pseudocoding the necessary steps to generate a password. 
    2. Defining the variables I would be needing to generate a password. 
    3. Creating functions to generate a password. 
    4. Utilizing console.log, the debugger tool, and Chrome DevTools to ensure the variables and functions are working properly until I got the code where I wanted it to be.
